# This code is bad

But I think it is really interesting!

I am using this as a playground for learning about interpreters, Scheme, and
programming with Haskell.

Long term, I would like this to be an actual working Scheme interpreter with
better support for debugging tools and better error messages. I would also like
to learn some about static analysis and nanopass compilers.
