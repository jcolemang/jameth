* Scheme Analysis

This is a library I am writing for a functional programming design class. My
main intention is to create a reasonable static analysis library to be used by
students current at Rose-Hulman. I would ideally also like to create an
interpreter to go along with it to simplify Scheme's debugging experience.

Note that I am using this in part as a playground for learning about Haskell,
static analysis, and interpreters. If you see bad code I would love to hear how
you would improve it.

* Building

  To build this, you will need ~stack~ and ~ghc~. To build all executables, run
  ~stack build~. To install the executables you can run ~stack install~. To run
  each individual binary, run it like ~stack exec -- analysis-server~.
